<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a guy that loves animes and games, been a NEET for quite some time after
  I finished gamedev school and learned it wasn't for me.
</p>
<p>
  But programming was always a passion that I wanted to apply somewhere and I
  have been enjoying the process of webdevelopment which reignited that passion
  for programming.
